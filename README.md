# react-demo

React is a javascript library that gives us the ability to build some awesome single page applications using only javascript. This library allows us to build an interactive UI utilizing a modular component structure. The goal here is to break our code up into re-usable modules that can update our UI in a simple and efficient manner.


Before creating your Repo, create a new React App in our U2 directory with `npm create vite@latest` command
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
Done. Now run:
```bash
  cd react-demo
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
Open the browser and navigate to the following to see the app is running succesfully:
```bash
http://localhost:5173/
```
Out of the box we get a few files and folders:

- `src`
  - this folder is where we'll write the majority of our code.
- `public`
  - the location of our index.html
  - This index.html file will be what's displayed in the browser later on.
- `node_modules`
  - a folder that contains all of the necessary dependencies or packages for our project
- `package.json`
  - a file that contains a list of scripts and dependencies our project needs in order to run
 

Now connect a Repo
```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "first commit"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin <<githubrepo>>
  git push -u origin main
```
