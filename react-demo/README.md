# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# react-demo

React is a javascript library that gives us the ability to build some awesome single page applications using only javascript. This library allows us to build an interactive UI utilizing a modular component structure. The goal here is to break our code up into re-usable modules that can update our UI in a simple and efficient manner.

Create a new React App in our U2 directory with `npm create vite@latest` command

```
npm create vite@latest
```

Done. Now run:

```
  cd react-demo
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

Out of the box we get a few files and folders:

- `src`
  - this folder is where we'll write the majority of our code.
- `public`
  - the location of our index.html
  - This index.html file will be what's displayed in the browser later on.
- `node_modules`
  - a folder that contains all of the necessary dependencies or packages for our project
- `package.json`
  - a file that contains a list of scripts and dependencies our project needs in order to run
